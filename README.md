# **Introduction to bioinformatics**




**Introduction to Bioinformatics** is a _challenging_, but worthwhile course to take at GWU.  [See if the class is availble to take](https://my.gwu.edu/mod/pws/). You will learn about all sorts of different software such as: [**BLAST**](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi), [**PubMed**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), or [**MAFFT**](https://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/server/)

## About Me

- My name is Lexie Miller and I am a current senior at GWU majoring in Neuroscience. I have always been fascinated by how the brain works for pretty much my entire life, so when the neuroscience major was implemented my sophomore year at GW, I was very excited!
- At first, I was very hesitant to take this course because I thought it would be extremely difficult. However, while this course is most certainly challenging, it's been amazing to see my hard work pay off and to be able to tangibly see all my hard work whether it's creating a FASTA file, making phylogenetic trees, MSA, or even creating my own website! 
## Favorite Food

My all time favorite food is pasta. It has been ever since I was kid and it's an ongoing joke in my house. However, I have the biggest sweet tooth in the world and am a big chocolate lover and will eat any and all things chocolate. I also really love spicy food so some of my favorite foods are thai food, indian food, or mexican food. 





## Favorite Hobbies

Being in quarantine has given me a lot of time to explore different hobbies. I have always loved watching TV and movies, and I feel like I have watched them all at this point. Currently I am watching The Queen's Gambit. I also love to listen to podcasts, especially when I am walking through DC and one of my favorites is called 'Crime Junkies' (it's a true crime podcast). I also enjoy baking and have made everything from bagels to banana bread to brownies while I was home in NJ. The best banana bread recipe is [**here**](https://www.food.com/recipe/best-banana-bread-2886). I also love doing yoga and have found a lot of great classes on YouTube. 





## Favorite Movies

I am a sucker for romantic comedies, and some of my all time favorite movies include 'The Notebook', 'Crazy, Stupid, Love', and 'Silver Linings Playbook'.


## Favorite Music
I am by far the biggest Taylor Swift fan on the planet. I have been a fan of hers since I was 7 Years Old and I have been to 7 of her concerts. I think I know all of the words to all of her songs. That being said, I truly do love all kinds of music. Most of my playlists are scattered with different genres ranging from pop to rock to hip hop to alternative. 





## Thank you!

Thank you Professor Crandall and Tyson for a wonderful semester. I know being in the COVID-age and being on zoom all semester hasn't been easy, but I appreciate all of the hard work you both put into this class!
